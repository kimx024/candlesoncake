# candlesoncake
*Who doesn't love to add and blow out candles on their birthday!? (Or any other day, for that matters...)*

"Candles on Cake" is a creative project I saw and wanted to expand on. It is literally timeless (if you aging up, that is). 
This project serves as an understanding about possible interactions between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All while enjoying a happy memmory of making a wish while blowing out some candles on a delicious cake. *(No direct physical copy to stimulate the olfactory senses included, unfortunately)*

### MY goals for this project
- Creating a digital (birthday) cake to my heart's content which allows me to play with a CSS-file for as long as I wanted. And seeing the changes immediately through the `main.html` file.
- Understanding the importance of **hierachy and structure** by using one centred `main.html` file for the interaction. The grand requirement was that it needed to be clean, which forced me to use more than one style sheet, for example.
- Include interactivity in the project, by introducing JavaScript. I never actively coded in JS, thus this was quite a challenge to understand. And I am 100% confident that I made and will make a lot of mistakes on the way.

All in all it's a delicously fun way of coding! :)
